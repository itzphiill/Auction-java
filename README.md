# Auction-java

Auction-java is a Java auction system created by using the spring framework, and storing information as users, bid, items in mysql server. When you run online auction, you access the interface with a browser.
You log in with  the user p.kellllly@gmail.com test123, and place a bid on a item or sell a item. Or you can log in with the admin karwangara@gmail.com test123, as a admin you have the privilege of removing a user from the website and items.
Once a bid is over the one that has the highest bid will be informed that they have won through email.

Exercising the example
To simulate an auction, you'll need to log into the two users and one item. Once created, you can bid on the item. By using different browsers, you can log in as different users and bid on the same item.
